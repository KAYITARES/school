                       <td>The Nursery Section has 15 classes with an average of 30 pupils per class. Each class teacher has an assistant. We strongly believe that special attention should be accorded to the little ones and thus skilled  teachers are always in class providing the required attention.

                          The Nursery Section has 12 streams and each stream is divided as follows: Nursery 1 for the three years olds, Nursery 2 for the 4 years old, and Nursery 3 for the 5 years old managed by a team of 31 professionals in nursery teaching. The Nursery Section has two sections: one section takes English as the command language and the other takes French as the command language.

                          The School is opened from Monday to Friday from 7 am to 12.45 pm. Nursery pupils are picked by their parents from their classes.

                           The list of all the school material is available at the School office. This material is held and kept by class teachers. Parents are requested to only adhere to the list provided by the School.

                          In the morning, upon entering the School premises, the main gate (close to HYGEBAT) is reserved for the Nursery pupils while the second gate (close to Glory Seconday) is for the Primary and Secondary students. At the end of classes, all students can use both gates.</td>
