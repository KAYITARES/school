                 <h1><em>Welcome to Saint Joseph Primary Web site</em></h1>
                 <p>Saint Joseph Primary Section consists of six classes, with two sections-one section takes English as the command  language and the other takes French as the command language.
                   Whatever the Section students go to, they take English as a compulsory subject for the French Section and French as a compulsory subject for the English Section. When pupils join Primary six, they are taught in English as a command language in a bid to prepare for their national exams that are set in English.
                    These languages are taught by well trained teachers who ensure that they contribute towards building a competent breed of bilingual pupils. Knowing both languages enables us equip our students with linguistic skills. </p>
